# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This study guide was made to help my combine the information I have learned during the Pre Work section of my classes at CWRU bootcamp. I built this as a way to help me easily find and review information as I move further into the classes. This project contains my notes taken on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

This Study Guide can be used as a quick reference for basic notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. It can also be used as a reference for different coding functions and commands, and can serve in the future as a project to build on for future website designs. The Study Guide lists topics we have learned from the Pre Work and even chooses one topic at random for us to study.
